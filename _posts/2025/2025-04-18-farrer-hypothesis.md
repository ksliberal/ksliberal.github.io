The synoptic problem… how to explain the literary relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke… has challenged biblical scholars for centuries. While the **Two-Source Hypothesis** (positing Mark and a hypothetical *Q* document as sources for Matthew and Luke) remains dominant… the **Farrer Hypothesis** has emerged as a significant alternative. Here we examine the origins, evidence, scholarly reception, and current status of this increasingly influential theory.

## Origins and Definition of the Farrer Hypothesis

The Farrer hypothesis (also called the L/M hypothesis, the Farrer–Goulder hypothesis, or the Farrer–Goulder–Goodacre hypothesis) proposes a solution to the synoptic problem that eliminates the need for a hypothetical Q document. Named after Austin Farrer, who published *On Dispensing With Q* in 1955, the theory has been subsequently developed by scholars Michael Goulder and Mark Goodacre[^1].

The hypothesis maintains a simple chronological progression:  
1. Mark was written first  
2. Matthew used Mark as a source  
3. Luke used both Mark and Matthew as sources[^1][^3]

This framework explains both the triple tradition (material in all three gospels) and the double tradition (material shared only by Matthew and Luke) without invoking Q. The Farrer theory honors Marcan priority while suggesting direct literary dependence between Matthew and Luke[^5][^10].

## Evidence Supporting the Farrer Hypothesis

### The Principle of Parsimony

Advocates of the Farrer theory highlight its simplicity as a primary strength. Following Occam's Razor—the principle that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity—the hypothesis eliminates the need for a hypothetical Q document for which no historical evidence exists[^2]. As Goodacre writes, "there is no ancient, external evidence of any kind for Q's existence. There are no textual witnesses, no fragments, no patristic citations—nothing. It is purely a scholarly construct, a hypothetical text"[^12].

### Editorial Fatigue

Perhaps the most compelling evidence offered by Farrer proponents is the phenomenon of "editorial fatigue." This occurs when a later author initially changes material from a source but gradually slips back into following the source text more closely. Mark Goodacre has identified several potential examples of this phenomenon suggesting Luke's dependence on Matthew[^8][^10].

One frequently cited example involves the Minor Agreements between Matthew and Luke against Mark. In the Passion narrative, both Matthew 26:68 and Luke 22:64 include the identical Greek phrase "Who is it that struck you?" (*τίς ἐστιν ὁ παίσας σε*) which is absent in Mark's account. The word *παίω* (strike) appears only once in both Matthew and Luke, suggesting direct literary dependence rather than coincidence[^10].

### Inconsistencies in Luke's Adaptation

The Parable of the Talents/Pounds presents another potential case of editorial fatigue. In Luke's version, ten servants are initially mentioned, but only three are addressed in the narrative. This inconsistency makes more sense if Luke was adapting Matthew's more coherent account about three servants rather than both independently using Q[^8].

## Arguments Against the Farrer Hypothesis

### The Problem of Lukan Omissions

The primary objection to the Farrer theory concerns Luke's omission of substantial Matthean material. Critics ask why Luke would exclude the Lord's Prayer, the Beatitudes, or Matthew's infancy narratives if he had access to Matthew's gospel[^4]. The traditional explanation from Two-Source theorists is that Luke worked independently of Matthew, using only Mark and Q.

Farrer proponents counter that Luke's prologue suggests he recognized many narratives before him and sought to provide an orderly account, potentially implying that he excluded Matthean material he deemed unreliable[^4].

### Primitive Nature of Luke's Text

Some scholars argue that Luke's text occasionally appears more primitive than Matthew's, which would contradict the Farrer chronology. For instance, Luke's version of certain parables and sayings is often more abbreviated and less theologically developed than Matthew's parallel accounts[^8].

The website LukePrimacy.com systematically challenges Goodacre's editorial fatigue arguments, suggesting that Luke represents the most primitive gospel tradition which Mark embellished and Matthew further expanded. They note that when comparing parallel passages, Luke typically uses fewer Greek words than Mark or Matthew, suggesting it may preserve an earlier, less elaborated tradition[^8].

### Alternative Explanations for Minor Agreements

The Two-Source Hypothesis has developed various explanations for the minor agreements between Matthew and Luke against Mark, including textual corruption, overlapping Q and oral traditions, and independent editorial decisions[^2]. While Farrer proponents find these explanations strained, they remain plausible alternatives to direct literary dependence.

## Scholarly Reception and Current Status

### Growing Alternative to the Dominant Paradigm

While the Two-Source Hypothesis remains dominant in academic circles, particularly in North America, the Farrer Hypothesis has gained significant traction as the primary alternative solution. One Reddit commenter described it as "a strong alternative (and very popular on this sub) rather than fringe"[^10], while another noted it's "the only real challenge to the 2-Source Hypothesis"[^6].

### Academic Divide and Advocacy

The Farrer theory has found more acceptance in the United Kingdom than in the United States[^2]. Mark Goodacre's persistent advocacy through books, articles, and digital media has significantly raised the hypothesis's profile in recent decades. His work *The Case Against Q* (2002) represents a thorough modern argument for the Farrer position[^6].

### Scholarly Neglect and Recent Recognition

Despite its merits, the Farrer theory has often been overlooked in biblical scholarship. Mark Goodacre has documented numerous cases where textbooks and scholarly works present the synoptic problem solely as a choice between the Two-Source Hypothesis and the Griesbach Hypothesis, completely ignoring the Farrer alternative[^11].

Eric Eve's 2021 book *Solving the synoptic puzzle: introducing the case for the Farrer hypothesis* indicates increasing scholarly attention. Eve argues that "No longer is it safe to assume that the long dominant Two Document Hypothesis can be accepted without much question"[^3].

## Competing Alternative Hypotheses

The debate extends beyond just the Two-Source and Farrer hypotheses. Other alternatives include:

1. **The Griesbach Hypothesis**: Proposes Matthean priority, with Luke using Matthew and Mark using both[^6]  
2. **The Wilke Hypothesis**: Suggests Matthew used Mark and Luke rather than Luke using Mark and Matthew[^5]  
3. **Lukan Priority**: Argues Luke was written first, followed by Mark and then Matthew[^8]  

The Jerusalem School scholars like Robert Lindsey and Halvor Ronning advocate for Lukan priority, viewing Mark as a "re-write man" who embellished Luke's more primitive account with *targumic* or *midrashic* qualities[^8].

## Conclusion

The Farrer Hypothesis represents a robust challenge to the dominant Two-Source Hypothesis, offering a simpler solution that eliminates the need for a hypothetical Q document. Its strongest evidence lies in the phenomenon of editorial fatigue and the principle of parsimony, while its greatest challenge remains explaining Luke's omission of Matthean material.

Recent scholarship suggests growing recognition of the Farrer theory's merits, though it remains secondary to the Two-Source Hypothesis in academic acceptance. As biblical scholars increasingly engage with the evidence both for and against the Farrer Hypothesis, the debate continues to evolve, challenging long-held assumptions about the relationships between the synoptic gospels.

The trajectory suggests that while Q may remain the dominant paradigm for now, the Farrer Hypothesis has secured its place as a serious alternative that cannot be dismissed without engagement. In biblical scholarship, as in other fields, dominant paradigms can shift when compelling alternatives gain critical mass… a process the Farrer Hypothesis may be steadily advancing.
