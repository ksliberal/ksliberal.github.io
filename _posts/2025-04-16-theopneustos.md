From <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/2ti/3/16/t_conc_1128016" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16</a> (NKJV Greek-English Interlinear):

> Πᾶσα γραφὴ **θεόπνευστος (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2315/nkjv/tr/0-1/" target="_blank">G2315</a>)** καὶ ὠφέλιμος πρὸς διδασκαλίαν, πρὸς ἔλεγχον, πρὸς ἐπανόρθωσιν, πρὸς παιδείαν τὴν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ

*All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness*

**Etymology**

- **θεός** (theos) - God
- **πνέω** (pneo) - to breathe/blow

The word θεόπνευστος (theopneustos) is a rare and likely original "coinage" by the author of 2 Timothy… a deliberate fusion of θεός (theos, God) and πνέω (pneō, to breathe). It doesn't appear elsewhere in the New Testament, the Septuagint, or much of classical Greek literature, suggesting it was crafted to express something both urgent and theologically unique.

While it's often translated as God-breathed, this single word has borne the weight of centuries of theological reflection. Its semantic range includes the idea of divine origin, life-giving breath, and ongoing spiritual efficacy. As the linked article explores, recent scholarship has reopened the question: Was θεόπνευστος intended to mean "inspired," or something more like "life-giving" or "animated by God's breath"?

So Christ is the Word (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3056/nkjv/tr/0-1/" target="_blank">λόγος</a>).

Scripture is the Breath (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4151/nkjv/tr/0-1/" target="_blank">πνεῦμα</a>)?
