This blog is maintained on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.io/) theme. My text editor is [Bear](https://bear.app/). Code with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.io/). Images are either mine or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

You didn't ask but the browsers I use are [Arc](https://www.arc.net/), [OperaGX](https://opera.com/gx), and [Vivaldi](https://www.vivaldi.com/).

  <h6>One of my favorite features in Arc is the "peak window"</h6>

  <h6>One of my favorite features in OperaGX is the sidebars and the ability to control the ram and network used. Really great for a background communicator app. Especially good at running Pro.X.com. Running OperaGX lets me avoid running an app for X, Music, Facebook Messenger, Discord, and an IRC clientâ€¦ all with limited resource usage.</h6>

I recommend [Ground.news](https://ground.news/). [SAN.com](https://san.com), [Smerconish.com/headlines](https://smerconish.com/headlines) and [Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/) as daily must reads. 

I prefer the [New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-oxford-annotated-bible-with-apocrypha-9780190276072?cc=us&lang=en&). But also recommend the [NKJV Cultural Studies Backgrounds Bible](https://zondervanacademic.com/products/nkjv-cultural-backgrounds-study-bible-hardcover-red-letter-edition) and the [Orthodox Study Bible](https://store.ancientfaith.com/orthodox-study-bible-ancient-faith-edition).

[Divine Office](https://divineoffice.org/) is a great resource for prayer and meditation.

[Olivetree Bible](https://www.olivetree.com/) is a great resource for Bible reading and study.
